## CS4240 Reproducibility Project: Sequential Neural Processes
The repository contains an implementation of work proposed in the paper ["Sequential Neural Processes", Singh, Gautam, et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10264) created by **Group 45**, Yi Yao (Y.Yao-10@student.tudelft.nl). The implementation is developed using Pytorch framework. The network and hyperparameters follow the settings specified in the paper, and is with reference to the official code via https://github.com/singhgautam/snp. 

A jupyter notebook is included in the repository to provide an elaborated illustration on the sequential neual processes model introduced in the paper, and the implementation details during development.
